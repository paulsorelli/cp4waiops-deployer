### ‚ùó THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS
Please drop me a note on Slack or by mail nikh@ch.ibm.com if you find glitches or problems.


## üö® You can now also install Instana into your Cluster


This is provided `as-is`:

* I'm sure there are errors
* I'm sure it's not complete
* It clearly can be improved


**‚ùóThis has been tested for the new CP4WAIOPS v3.5.0 release on OpenShift 4.10 on ROKS**




So please if you have any feedback contact me 

- on Slack: @niklaushirt or
- by Mail: nikh@ch.ibm.com


‚ùóThose are **non-production** installations and are suited only for demo and PoC environments. ‚ùó

Please refer to the official IBM Documentation for production ready installations.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---------------------------------------------------------------
# üê• 1 Quick Install
---------------------------------------------------------------

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **This method doesn't require you to install anything on your local machine.**

* You get a OpenShift Cluster
* You get your entitlement key/pull token
* You paste the install file into the OpenShift web UI
* Grab a coffe and come back after 2-3 hours depending on the modules you're installing


üöÄ Already have a cluster? [Dive right in](#-12-install-ai-manager-with-demo-content)


> ü§ì So this could basically be done from an iPhone or iPad
 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## ‚úÖ 1.1 Prerequisites 

### ‚úÖ 1.1.1 OpenShift requirements 

I installed the demo in a ROKS environment.

You'll need:

- ROKS 4.10
- 5x worker nodes Flavour `b3c.16x64` (so **16 CPU / 64 GB**)  ‚ùó




You **might** get away with less if you don't install some components (Event Manager, ELK, Turbonomic,...) but no guarantee:

- Typically 4x worker nodes Flavour `b3c.16x64` _**for only AI Manager**_



### ‚úÖ 1.1.2 Get a ROKS Cluster (IBMers and IBM Partners only)

IBMers can get a temporary one from [Techzone](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/custom-roks-vmware-requests) (ususally valid for up to 8 days)

1. Create a cluster for `Practice/Self Education` if you don't have an Opportunity Number

	![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/roks01.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

1. Select the maximum end date that fits your needs (you can extend the duration once after creation)

	![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/roks03.png)
	
1. Fill-in the remaining fields

	1. Geograpy: prefer **Dallas or London** (others might be slower)
	2. Worker node count: **5**
	3. Flavour: **b3c.16x64** ‚ùó 
	4. OpenShift Version: **4.10**

	> ‚ùó If you want to install AIManager, Event Manager, Trubonomic and Instana please select **b3c.32x128** 

	![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/roks02.png)

1. Click `Submit`
	
1. Once the cluster is provisioned, don't forget to extend it to 8 days if needed.


### ‚úÖ 1.1.3 Get the CP4WAIOPS installation token (registry pull token) 

You can get the installation (registry pull token) token from [https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary).

This allows the CP4WAIOPS images to be pulled from the IBM Container Registry.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è 1.2 Important remarks before you start ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Those are remarks to feedback and problem reports I got from the field.

Those scripts have been tested thoroughly on different environments and have proven to be VERY reliable.

If you think that you hit a problem:

* Make sure that you have provisioned a cluster with **5 worker nodes with 16 CPU and 64 GB** each (`b3c.16x64` - it's easy to select the wrong size). If you have Pods in `0/0` state verify the `Events`. If you get `Not enough CPU` then delete the cluster and provision the correct size.
* If you want to install AIManager, Event Manager, Trubonomic and Instana please select **5 worker nodes with 32 CPU and 128 GB** (`b3c.32x128`)
* When deploying ROKS I usually use Dallas or London, they are the fastest. On other regions we have seen much worse performance - deployment can take 4-5 times longer.
* The complete installation takes about 2.5 to 8 hours depending on your region where you deployed ROKS to (see above).
* If you see Pods in `CrashLoop` or other error states, try to wait it out (this can be due to dependencies on other componenets that are not ready yet). Chances are that the deployment will eventually go through. If after 8h you are still stuck, ping me.
* **Select and use ONLY ONE of the scripts** below, depending on which components you want to install.




### ‚ùó So simply put be patient and make sure you have the correct size of cluster provisioned!

## üê• 1.3 Quick Install 

You can use the scritps in the `Quick_Install` folder to rapidly spin up a demo environment.
The names should be self explaining and the headers of the files explain the modules to be installed.

> Basically you would to the following:
> 
> 1. In the the OCP Web UI click on the `+` sign in the right upper corner
> 1. Select the `Quick Install File` from  [this directory](./Quick_Install/)
> 3. Replace `<REGISTRY_TOKEN>` at the end of the file with your pull token from step 1.1.3 (the Entitlement key from https://myibm.ibm.com)
> 3. Click `Save`	

Some examples in the following chapters.

# 2 Demo the Solution
---------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.1 Simulate incident - Web Demo UI

üìπ I have added a short [Demo Walkthrough video](https://ibm.box.com/s/a4zbl8rjevxqfe48yxgatgmhomsiu8wl) that you can watch to get an idea on how to do the demo. This is based on 3.2 and the [Click Through PPT](https://ibm.box.com/s/icgkxzlt2ja6dth16dpdin055uyysej1), but should work more or less with your own instance.

![demo](./doc/pics/demo02.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>





<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


## 2.2 Demo Setup - Explained

### 2.2.1 Basic Architecture

The environement (Kubernetes, Applications, ...) create logs that are being fed into a Log Management Tool (ELK in this case).

![demo](./doc/pics/waiops_arch_overview.jpg)

1. External Systems generate Alerts and send them into the AI Manager for Event Grouping.
1. At the same time AI Manager ingests the raw logs coming from the Log Management Tool (ELK) and looks for anomalies in the stream based on the trained model.
2. It also ingests Metric Data and looks for anomalies
1. If it finds an anomaly (logs and/or metrics) it forwards it to the Event Grouping as well.
1. Out of this, AI Manager creates a Story that is being enriched with Topology (Localization and Blast Radius) and with Similar Incidents that might help correct the problem.
1. The Story is then sent to Slack.
1. A Runbook is available to correct the problem but not launched automatically.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.2.2 Optimized Demo Architecture

The idea of this repo is to provide a optimised, complete, pre-trained demo environment that is self-contained (e.g. can be deployed in only one cluster)

It contains the following components (which can be installed independently):

 - **AI Manager**
 	- IBM Operator
 	- AI Manager Instance
 - **AI Manager Demo Content**  (optional)
    - **OpenLDAP** & Register with AI Manager
    - **AWX** (Open Source Ansible Tower) with preloaded Playbooks
    - **AI Models** - Load and Train 
      - Create Training Definitions (TG, LAD, CR, SI. Turn off RSA) 
      - Create Training Data (LAD, SNOW) 
      - Train Models (TG, LAD, CR, SI) 
    - **Topology**
      - RobotShop Demo App
      - Create K8s Observer
      - Create ASM merge rules
      - Load Overlay Topology
      - Create AI Manager Application
    - **Misc**
 	   - Creates valid certificate for Ingress (Slack) 
 	   - External Routes (Flink, Topology, ...)
 	   - Disables ASM Service match rule 
 	   - Create Policy Creation for Stories and Runbooks 
 	   - Demo Service Account 
 - **Event Manager**  (optional)
 	- Event Manager
 - **Event Manager Demo Content**  (optional)
   - **Topology**
     - Create ASM merge rules
     - Load ASM merge Topology
     - Create AI Manager Application
 - **Turbonomic**  (optional)
 - **Turbonomic Demo Content** (optional)
	- Demo User
	- RobotShop Demo App with synthetic metric
	- Instana target (if Instana is installed - you have to enter the API Token Manually)
	- Groups for vCenter and RobotShop
	- Groups for licensing
	- Resource Hogs
 - **Instana**  (optional)

![demo](./doc/pics/waiops_arch_dataflow.jpg)


For the this specific Demo environment:

* ELK is not needed as I am using pre-canned logs for training and for the anomaly detection (inception)
* Same goes for Metrics, I am using pre-canned metric data for training and for the anomaly detection (inception)
* The Events are also created from pre-canned content that is injected into AI Manager
* There are also pre-canned ServiceNow Incidents if you don‚Äôt want to do the live integration with SNOW
* The Webpages that are reachable from the Events are static and hosted on my GitHub
* The same goes for ServiceNow Incident pages if you don‚Äôt integrate with live SNOW

This allows us to:

* Install the whole Demo Environment in a self-contained OCP Cluster
* Trigger the Anomalies reliably
* Get Events from sources that would normally not be available (Instana, Turbonomic, Log Aggregator, Metric Provider, ...)
* Show some examples of SNOW integration without a live system


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.2.3 Training

#### 2.2.3.1 Loading training data

![demo](./doc/pics/waiops_arch_training.jpg)

Loading Training data is done at the lowest possible level (for efficiency and speed):

* Logs: Loading Elastic Search indexes directly into ES - two days of logs for March 3rd and 4th 2022
* SNOW: Loading Elastic Search indexes directly into ES - synthetic data with 15k change requests and 5k incidents
* Metrics: Loading Cassandra dumps of metric data - 3 months of synthetic data for 13 KPIs


#### 2.2.3.2 Training the models

The models can be trained directly on the data that has been loaded as described above.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


### 2.2.4 Incident creation (inception)

![demo](./doc/pics/waiops_arch_inception.jpg)

Incidents are being created by using the high level APIs in order to simulate a real-world scenario.

* Events: Pre-canned events are being injected through the corresponding REST API
* Logs: Pre-canned anomalous logs for a 30 min timerange are injected through Kafka
* Metrics: Anomalous metric data are generated on the fly and injected via the corresponding REST API

```
git clone https://github.com/paulsorelli/cp4waiops-deployer.git
```


## 3.2 Prerequisites 


### 3.2.1 OpenShift requirements 

I installed the demo in a ROKS environment.

You'll need:

- ROKS 4.10
- 5x worker nodes Flavour `b3c.16x64` (so 16 CPU / 64 GB) 




You **might** get away with less if you don't install some components (Event Manager, ELK, Turbonomic,...) but no guarantee:

- Typically 4x worker nodes Flavour `b3c.16x64` _**for only AI Manager**_

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.2.2 Get a ROKS Cluster (IBMers and IBM Partners only)

IBMers can get a temporary one from [Techzone](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/custom-roks-vmware-requests) (ususally valid for 2 weeks)

1. Create a cluster for `Practice/Self Education` if you don't have an Opportunity Number

	![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/roks01.png)

1. Select the maximum end date that fits your needs (you can extend the duration once after creation)

	![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/roks03.png)
	
1. Fill-in the remaining fields

	1. Geograpy: whatever is closest to you
	2. Worker node count: 5
	3. Flavour: b3c.16x64
	4. OpenShift Version: 4.10

	![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/roks02.png)

1. Click `Submit`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.2.3 Tooling 

‚ùó Only needed if you decide to install from your PC

You need the following tools installed in order to follow through this guide:

- ansible
- oc (4.8 or greater)
- jq
- kafkacat (only for training and debugging)

For the system to work you need to follow those steps:


1. Create Slack Workspace
1. Create Slack App
1. Create Slack Channels
1. Create Slack Integration
1. Get the Integration URL
1. Create Slack App Communications
1. Slack Reset

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


## 4.1 Create your Slack Workspace

1. Create a Slack workspace by going to https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew and logging in with an email <i>**which is not your IBM email**</i>. Your IBM email is part of the IBM Slack enterprise account and you will not be able to create an independent Slack workspace outside if the IBM slack service. 

  ![slack1](./doc/pics/slackws1.png)

2. After authentication, you will see the following screen:

  ![slack2](./doc/pics/slackws2.png)

3. Click **Create a Workspace** ->

4. Name your Slack workspace

  ![slack3](./doc/pics/slackws3.png)

  Give your workspace a unique name such as aiops-\<yourname\>.

5. Describe the workspace current purpose

  ![slack4](./doc/pics/slackws4.png)

  This is free text, you may simply write ‚Äúdemo for Watson AIOps‚Äù or whatever you like.

6. 

  ![slack5](./doc/pics/slackws5.png)

  You may add team members to your new Slack workspace or skip this step.


At this point you have created your own Slack workspace where you are the administrator and can perform all the necessary steps to integrate with CP4WAOps.

![slack6](./doc/pics/slackws6.png)

**Note** : This Slack workspace is outside the control of IBM and must be treated as a completely public environment. Do not place any confidential material in this Slack workspace.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4.2 Create Your Slack App

1. Create a Slack app, by going to https://api.slack.com/apps and clicking `Create New App`.
